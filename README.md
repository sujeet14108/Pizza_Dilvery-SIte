<b>Customer View:</b>
Customers could create a new order or track their placed order.
So the first page should provide the user with these two options.
<ul><li>
For Option: Create new order</li>
On creating a new order the system should generate an order id which the user would use to track the placed order in future.
<br>Once the id is generated and displayed to the user, he/she should be displayed a menu short one containing about 4 varieties of pizzas with 3 sizes available
<li> Add appropriate check</li>
boxes for the user to select the item and a field to input the quantity of each(set default to 1 which would be considered only if the checkbox is checked).
<br>It would be even better if you
could add images for every item.<br>
On clicking submit, the webpage should navigate to another form asking the user to enterhis name, contact number and address as
mandatory fields
<li>
You must maintain the session(maintain order id and selected items)<br>
while the previous page navigates to this page and display your order id on the top of the page.
On entering the personal details the user should be able to navigate to the tracking page ohis/her order indicating the progress till Order Placed.
States should increment to the next stage.<br>
<li>System:</li>
The system should maintain the status of every order at the backend(maybe in a file) to be
able to update and track the current status</ul>
